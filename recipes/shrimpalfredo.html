    <h3><strong><em>Fried Rice</em></strong> Rice is a combination of long grained rice, mixture of warm peas, carrots and onions with scrambled eggs mixed all together! You will not be getting take out any longer! </h3>

    <p>I have always loved fried rice. I could probably eat an entire bowl. The great thing about this recipe is that you can add whatever you would like! I have added bacon, chicken, and ham. It is the perfect fried rice base and they say the secret ingredient to get the authentic Chinese taste is sesame oil. Whatever it may be it is fantastic!</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Shrimp</li>
        <li>Fettuccini pasta</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Parmesean Cheese</li>
        <li>Garlic Clove</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Season the shrimp. Sprinkle the raw shrimp with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the shrimp. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook the shrimp on both sides for 7-8 minutes total, until they become pink and opaque. Take them out of the pan and set them aside in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Add the butter and garlic. Place the butter and garlic into the same pan and cook over medium heat for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Simmer the heavy cream. Pour the heavy cream into the pan and raise the heat to medium-high. Then, allow the cream to reach a simmer before taking the pan off the heat and adding the Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta and shrimp. Once the cheese has been thoroughly incorporated, add the shrimp and pasta. You can add more salt, if needed. For a little extra flavor, garnish the shrimp alfredo pasta with some chopped fresh parsley and serve.</li>
