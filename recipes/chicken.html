        Air Fryers have changed cooking. It’s so quick and easy and everything that comes out tastes amazing. I love it. This is such a healthy way to cook chicken or any other dish for that matter. It uses the same method as a convection oven but this way you don’t have to heat the whole oven for just a few chicken breasts. It’s quick and the clean up is so easy.

    <p>Chicken can be finicky sometimes, and hard to get juicy and tender each and every time. The air fryer method takes a lot of the guess work out for you. You will just need to take the Chickens temperature to ensure doneness, and that you don’t overcook it.  This is so versatile so change it up as you need to and enjoy.</p>
